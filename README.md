What it does
Why it is used
When to use (Any constraints on conditions)
Run time and Space complexity

## Search
    -> Binary Search

## Sorting
    -> Native / inbuilt sort add a comparefunction, like [].sort((a,b)=>a<b); Else it will convert to string and compare in string unicode.
    -> Insertion sort, Merge sort, quick sort

## Abstract Data type and Data Structures
    -> Stack, linkedlist, queue, BST
    -> Tree traversal - inorder,preorder,postorder
    -> Priority Queue 
        -> min/max Heap, heap sort
    -> Dictionary 
        -> hash table 
    -> Self balancing trees - all levels in parents filled before moving to next level, to avoid worst case in BST (height is O(n))
        -> https://www.shmoop.com/computer-science/cs-trees/balancing-trees.html
        -> 2-3, 2-3-4, B-tree, red black trees

## Graphs
	-> Graph representations
	-> DFS, BFS, Topological sort
	-> Strongly connected components
	-> Minimum spanning tree
		-> Kruskal
			-> Union-find set operations
		-> Prim
	-> Shortest path
		-> Dijkstra , single source shortest path
		-> floyd warshall, all pairs shortest path, Transitive closure

## Augumenting data structures
	-> Selection problem
	-> order-statistic tree
	-> interval search

## Divide and conquer
	-> Closest pair of points on a plane
	-> quick sort avoiding worst case
	-> order selection

## Greedy 
	-> activity selection
	-> huffman encoding

## Dynamic programming
	-> Rod cutting
	-> LCS
	-> Optimal binary search tree.

## Advanced 
	-> Self balancing tree
		-> AVL, Splay tree
	-> sorting
		-> radix sort
		-> bucket sort
		
## AND MANY MORE ...
